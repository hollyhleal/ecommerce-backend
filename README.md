# E-Commerce Back End

In this project, I created a back end for an e-commerce website.

I completed the following:

1. Given a functional Express.js API, when I add the database name, MySQL username and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
2. When I enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and seeded with test data.
3. When I enter the command to invoke the application `npm start`, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
4. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in formatted JSON.
5. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create, update and delete data in my database.
